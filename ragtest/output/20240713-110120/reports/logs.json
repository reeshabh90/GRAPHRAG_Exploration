Concurrency means \nall processes(tasks) progressing together but at one time only one task being \nexecuted by the CPU core. Tasks compete for CPU time. Traditional systems \nevolved from using one CPU core to employing multiple CPU cores with each \nCPU core performing tasks in parallel, and thus allowing for more scope for multi-\ntasking. Each CPU core can be involved in execution of separate process in \nparallel. Notice the gradual evolution from concurrency to parallelism.  In a \nmulti-core system, multiple processor cores operate parallel, which reduces \ncontention for the CPU among different tasks and helps distribute the workload. \nModern systems take a mixed approach of using concurrency on one core and \ndistributing tasks across multiple cores (parallelism). \nSo far in our discussion, we have talked about how a computer or OS reacts to \nthe events generated by users and processes the instructions. But what does it \nmean by execution of an instruction or performing a task? Let us shift our \ndiscussion briefly towards what a process is and then we shall resume our \ndiscussion related to multiple processes executing together. \n2.3 Process \nIn the computing world, we provide the computer with a set\n######################\nOutput:"}}

While it is possible for the stack and heap to overlap, the OS \ntypically starts them far apart to avoid this. If the stack and heap were to overlap, \nit could lead to issues such as buffer overflow, unpredictable behavior, and \nmemory corruption. Modern operating systems use various mechanisms, such \nas virtual memory guard pages, to prevent the stack from growing into the heap \nand vice versa. Guard pages are memory pages strategically placed between the \nstack and heap segments by the operating system during memory allocation. \nThese pages are marked as inaccessible, which basically means that any attempt \nto access these guard pages (read/write) will trigger an error, typically a \nsegmentation fault or a similar memory access violation. So, an effective \nmemory barrier is created between the stack and heap. Any attempt by a \nprogram to access memory beyond the stack or heap boundaries, such as by \nattempting to grow the stack into the heap or vice versa, will trigger an error \nwhen it encounters the guard page. \nThe Information about the memory layout of a process is stored in a data \nstructure called the Process Control Block (PCB). It contains details about the \nprocess, including the program counter, register values, memory allocation, and \nstatus. \nReesh\n######################\nOutput:"}}
