# Repository Name: RAG Exploration

## Description

Basic RAG method is based on similarity search of vectors and hence most of the times fails to capture the overall syntax of the text presented to it, especially understanding it at higher level. To solve this problem, Knowledge Graph based RAG has been introduced, and Microsoft's GRAPHRAG seems to be a gamechanger, which takes it even further by capturing the entities and their relationship at a very deeperlevel.

This Repository consists of 2 notebooks which compare the results of knowledge graphs generated by GRAPHRAG and simple LLM based model.

## Installation
