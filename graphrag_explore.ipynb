To solve this problem, Knowledge Graph based RAG has been introduced, and Microsoft's GRAPHRAG seems to be a gamechanger, which takes it even further by capturing the entities and their relationship at a very deeperlevel.\n",

A simple LLM generated knowledge graph may not be able to capture the required context of entire document, which has also been showcased via another notebook present in this repo: \"llmgraph.ipynb\".\n",

These workflows extract entities, relationships and claims from raw text, and then perform community detection in entities. \n",

    "### Hierarchical Leiden Algorithm : For Community Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the important steps in GRAPHRAG, after entity and relationship extraction, is to generate a hierarchy of entity communities using the Hierarchical Leiden Algorithm. Community detection involves identifying groups of nodes in a network that are more densely connected internally than with the rest of the network. It is helpful for understanding the structure and function of networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hierarchical Leiden algorithm builds on the already popular Louvain method for community detection but introduces several improvements to enhance accuracy, efficiency, and stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Leiden algorithm consists of three phases: (1) local moving of nodes, (2) refinement of the partition and (3) aggregation of the network based on the refined partition, using the non-refined partition to create an initial partition for the aggregate network. It recursively merges communities into single nodes by greedily optimizing the modularity and the process repeats in the condensed graph. \n",
    "The algorithm moves individual nodes from one community to another to find a partition, which is then refined. An aggregate network is created based on the refined partition, using the non-refined partition to create an initial partition for the aggregate network.\n",

    "\n",
    "Local Search is more relevant if we want to extract information about specific entities mentioned in the document. It combines relevant data from the AI-extracted knowledge-graph with text chunks of the raw documents. Local Search responds to user queries by identifying semantically-related entities and extracting relevant details from the knowledge graph and associated raw documents, all within a defined context window.\n",
    "\n",
    "The identified entities serve as initial access points into the knowledge graph. From these entities, Local Search can traverse the graph to extract further relevant details such as connected entities, relationships, entity covariates (attributes), and community reports. The extracted entities, relationships, and text chunks are prioritized based on their relevance to the user query. It is ensured that the selected data fits within a single context window of pre-defined size, optimizing it for response generation.\n",

Basic RAG performs terribly here because it relies on a vector search of semantically similar text content within the dataset. There is nothing in the query to direct it to the correct information.\n",
